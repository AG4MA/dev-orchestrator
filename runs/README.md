# Runs Directory

This directory contains run artifacts generated by the orchestrator.

Each run creates a subdirectory with:
- `state.json` - Run state and metadata
- `plan.json` - Execution plan
- `report.md` - Final report
- `execution.log` - Execution logs

## Structure

```

│   ├── state.json
│   ├── plan.json

```

## Note

Run directories are ignored by git (except this README).
For auditability, consider archiving important runs externally.
